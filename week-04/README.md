## JavaScript Challenge 4: Two Sum

[Two Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**Problem**:  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

**Example**:  
- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
- Output: `[0,1]`  
- Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
- Output: `[1,2]`

**Concepts**:  
- Array manipulation, hashing.

**Why**:  
This problem helps you practice handling arrays and applying efficient solutions using hashmaps.

## Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
